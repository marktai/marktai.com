            <p>Hello there!</p>

            <p>I'm Mark, and I've been a professional technical interview coach on <a href='https://interviewing.io/' target="_blank">interviewing.io</a> since January 2023. I was previously a senior engineer at Airbnb, a company notorious for its difficult technical interviews (here's my <a href='http://resume.marktai.com' target="_blank">resume</a>). I've guided my mentees to build their interviewing skills and land offers from FAANG+ companies, and I look forward to working with you too!</p>

            <p>I strive to understand your background to give you the most impactful and actionable feedback for wherever you are in your preparation journey. I always try to observe where you are with skills and emotions in the interviewing process so I can refine both your competence and confidence in an interview setting.</p>

            <p>My rate on interviewing.io is <a href='https://www.marktai.com/s/7141' target="_blank">$560 per hour session</a>, but send <a href="mailto:mark@marktai.com" target="_top">mark@marktai.com</a> an email for my current rates. I also offer UCLA students and URM students deeply discounted rates.</p>

            <p>My coaching course typically is a curated curriculum from me as well as asynchronous code review for homework problems that you solve between coaching sessions. I'll also be able to give you fine grained feedback after seeing your progress and understanding your interview goals. </p>

            <p>As a first step, we can plan a session where we can go over any final details or questions you might have, and then proceed into a mock interview. If you decide you don't want to proceed with the coaching course, we can just cancel before the mock, for no charge. </p>

            <p>I look forward to hearing from you at <a href="mailto:mark@marktai.com" target="_top">mark@marktai.com</a>!</p>
